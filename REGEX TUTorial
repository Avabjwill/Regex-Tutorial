# REGEX Tutorial

This is a REGEX tutorial on the use of a Matching Email expression. REGEX is an acronym for Regular Expression. Regular expression utilize a combination of patterns to recognize charecters. 

## Summary
The REGEX we will be discussing within this GIST is a Matching Email expression. We will deconstruct this following statement : /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.  
We will identify the Anchors, Quantifiers, Grouping Constructs, Bracket expressions, Charecter Classes, The OR Operator, Flags and Charecter Escapes.

## Regex Components
Below is the REGEX components:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

### Anchors
When taking a first look at the REGEX expression you would assume the slash (/) is the anchor but make no mistake that is the delimeter. 
The Anchor is identified to be the Caret key (^).

### Quantifiers
For understanding the Quantifier of a REGEX statement refer to the root word being Quantity.  
A Quanitifier represents the amount of instances a character, group, or character class will be present within the client input.

To identify the Quantifiers within the espression think of Quantity. 
[9] {2,6}

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping Construct outlines the subexpressions with a REGEX. 
Each Grouping Construct is identified by the use of Parenthesis ().


### Bracket Expressions
Bracket Expression is a bracket which has a list of charecters within.
Each Backet Expression is identified by the use of Brackets [].

### Character Classes
Charecter Classes defines the charecters within a string.
Charecter Classes within the REGEX given is 

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
